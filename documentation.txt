Minimal Viable Product (MVP) 

**Entities:**
- Hacking Team = team of students, sit at labeled tables, require judging
- Judge = sponsor that needs to visit and judge hacking teams
- WiCHacks Volunteer = "user" of web app; leads Judge around tables
-  Judging Team = combined unit of Judge and WiCHacks Volunteer; each will have one or more category
- Judging Category = each sponsor can have one or more categories (AI, gaming, etc.) that they score Hacking Teams on. Each Judge will only visit Hacking Teams that have submitted to one or more of their categoreis.

**Customer:**
- WiCHacks Volunteer, a.k.a the "user" 

**Goal:**
- Make it easier for WiCHacks Volunteer to lead the Judge to all required tables for respective judging categories without directly colliding with other Judging Teams on one table or overcrowding a group of neighboring tables when other table areas are more readily available.

**Features:** 
- Times judging session (60 seconds)
- Provide next table to Judging Team given it is ready for next table
